The CacheMatrix.R file contains the code for the two functions makeCacheMatrix and CacheSolve functions as described 
in Programming Assignment 2. These functions essentially check if the computationally intensive mathematical operation 
such as calculation of Inverse of a matrix has already been done, so that the Inverse might not be calculated again 
and again. This code helps in reducing the time required to access the mathematical results already computed once and 
stored in cache memory.
